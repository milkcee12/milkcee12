## 🐢 Hello!
I'm a computer science student and artist attending University of Southern California. When I'm not working my 🔭[personal site](https://milkcee12.github.io/) or 🌱[painting new worlds](https://www.instagram.com/milkcee12/), I'm eating eating pastries, drinking boba, and browsing Uniqlo graphic tees.
